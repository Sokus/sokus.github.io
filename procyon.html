            This is my current ongoing project in which I am trying to create a Co-Op Action-Adventure game for PC and PlayStation Portable.
            Why the PSP? Well, it was my first childhood console and also the reason I have started learning low-level programming in the first place.
            I am very curious to see what 333MHz MIPS R4000 CPU, 32MB of RAM and 2MB of GPU memory is capable of.

            Using Model 3D (M3D) format turned out to be a bad idea. The exporter messes up the UVs on mesh triangulation and the loader doesn't quite work on the PSP...
            Thanks to Jacob's <a href="https://github.com/MysteriousJ/Blender-Export-Scripting-Guide">Blender Export Scripting Guide</a> I was able to drop M3D dependency
            entirely and write my very own Blender exporter and model format - easy to load on PC and PSP. Right know I've got static mesh rendering on both platforms and
            about to work on skeletal animation next.

            I've decided not to use Model 3D (M3D) format in the client app directly. To render a model on PC or PSP I need to convert the data from M3D's data
            representation to something the engine could use. I wasn't concerned too much about desktop platforms - there is plenty of CPU power to do
            necessary conversions, but on the PSP I don't have CPU power or large amounts of memory to deal with. I think what I am going to do about it
            is to create two custom model formats, one for PC and one for PSP. Each of the platforms would get a format that is easy for them to load, ideally
            with minimal CPU and memory overhead. I am not experienced enough to write an entire Blender Exporter from scratch, but since I've already learned
            how to use M3D format, I decided to create a conversion tool.

            Once I've got basic network connection going on I thought it is time to work on rendering 3D models. I decided to use
            <a href="https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/model3d">Model 3D</a> SDK and file format, it promised small files and straightforward
            way to load models. With Model 3D I was able to load and display a textured model on PC.

            My biggest achievement with the project so far was getting PC and PSP client to connect to the same server. Networking abstraction,
            communication protocol and bit-serialization I have used in my <a href="engineering_thesis.html">Engineering Thesis</a>
            were completely rewritten - two times actually - which reduced the amount of code and helped detect some bugs introduced when implementing
            everything for the first time.
