            This is my current ongoing project in which I am trying to create a Co-Op Action-Adventure game for PC and PlayStation Portable.
            Why the PSP? Well, it was my first childhood console and also the reason I have started learning low-level programming in the first place.
            I am very curious to see what 333MHz MIPS R4000 CPU, 32MB of RAM and 2MB of GPU memory is capable of.

            My biggest achievement with the project so far was getting PC and PSP client to connect to the same server. Networking abstraction,
            communication protocol and bit-serialization I have used in my <a href="engineering_thesis.html" class="post_title">Engineering Thesis</a>
            were completely rewritten - two times actually - which reduced the amount of code and helped detect some bugs introduced when implementing
            everything for the first time.
