            This projects main purpose is to create a game, entirely under console terminal without any graphic libraries - it was the first
            project I have ever worked on. Apart from system headers and standard library this project has no dependencies.

        <p>
            This project is dependent on two Windows API functions, first one for getting the standard output handle:
        </p>
        <pre class="codeblock">
HANDLE WINAPI GetStdHandle(
    _In_ DWORD nStdHandle
);
        </pre>
        <p>
            And the second one that lets us change the color used in the terminal:
        </p>
        <pre class="codeblock">
BOOL WINAPI SetConsoleTextAttribute(
    _In_ HANDLE hConsoleOutput,
    _In_ WORD   wAttributes
);
        </pre>

        <p>
            It has only 16 colors to choose from, but by creatively using some ASCII characters (for example ▓▓▒▒░░) we could
            easily increase the number of perceived colors available to 784. All textures are stored as a series of numbers (color indices) in <code>.txt</code> files.
